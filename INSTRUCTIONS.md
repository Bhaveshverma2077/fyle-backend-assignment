To migrate, delete the `store.sqlite3` file in `core/` (if any), and execute the following commands in the Bash shell of the container weâ€™re about to open:

To get access to the bash shell inside the container, run from the root of the project:

```bash

```

Run the following command to migrate:

1. Set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable:

   ```bash
   export FLASK_APP="/APP/core/server"
   ```

2. Run the database migration:

   ```bash
   flask db upgrade -d ./core/migrations
   ```

After migrating, run the following command to execute the tests:
